      ##Instructor Notes

      ##Teens Learning Code: Create Your Own Brand Package with Pixlr

      <br>
      #Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong>Getting Started (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>: Elements of graphic design, colour theory, composition, typography
      * <strong>Critical design thinking (11:00 am - 12:30 pm)</strong>: analyzing logos, intro to branding, dive into Pixlr, interface basics
      * <strong>Lunch Break! (12:30 pm - 1:30 pm)</strong>
      * <strong>Using Pixlr (1:30 pm -2:00 pm)</strong>: Layers exercise, menu options, tools, history, starting on photo editing
      * <strong>Photo editing (2:00 pm - 2:30 pm)</strong>: Class exercise covering transform, resize, selections, eraser, layer styles
      * <strong>Personal brand (2:30 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>: Finding stock photos, organizing layers, choosing a colour palette, choosing typfaces
      * <strong>Logo design (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>: Choosing an icon, inverting colours, putting it altogether, next steps


      <br>
      #General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files from slide 1 - check in as people are entering the room to make sure they have learner files.
      Pixlr will require the learners to have Flash installed.
      If they want to be able to save a working file as they go along, or have the ability to edit their moodboard later, they will have to create an account on pixlr.com. They can still use the online in-browser editor. Once they are in the editor, they will see 'Login' and 'Sign up' buttons in the top right
      Encourage them to ask yourself or a mentor for help with installation!
      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.
      * Show learners how to use keyboard shortcuts to do things like undo, redo, and save their file as they go along. Remember to mention them especially since they're invisible to them when you use keyboard shortcuts on the overhead projector. PLEASE mention both Windows & Mac shortcuts, not just 1 or the other!
      * Share shortcuts and tips on navigating between windows. Hot corners, shortcut keys, taskbar hovers. Whatever works.

      #Specific Examples

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <strong>Slide 5: GRAPHIC DESIGN IS EVERYWHERE!</strong>

      Take a moment here to let the class contribute some ideas. You can also point to examples in the room, on their clothes, devices, etc.

      <strong>Slide 6: Signs</strong>

      What does this mean? And this? Etc. Graphic design uses colours and symbols to relay visual cues . . . Red... Orange...

      <strong>Slide 7: Album covers</strong>

      It’s used in Album Art to convey various tones of music and the musical style of the artist. You can usually tell a metal album cover when you see one because it conveys that tone.

      <strong>Slide 8: Logos</strong>

      Logos are another good example of graphic design and helps us visually remember businesses and brands.

      <strong>Slide 10: TO COMMUNICATE!</strong>
      Graphic design is often misinterpreted as just art, but its real purpose is to communicate with consumers/citizens. They can express an idea, a message or an emotion.
      There is nothing particulary artistic about a road sign, but the colours, shapes and symbols are carefully chosen to convey a message.

      <strong>Slide 12: EMOTION OF COLOUR</strong>
      Colour can often invoke a wide range of responses in a person.
      What do you think of when you see the colour Red? Blue? Yellow? Can you think of any companies or logos that use the colour RED?

      <strong>Slide 15: COMPOSITION</strong>
      These rules also apply to photography, print and web design! We are going to apply these principles to a logo.

      <strong>Slide 16: Symmetry</strong>
      Symmetry is pleasing to the human eye. If we were to cut the Maple Leaf in half, we would have a mirror image on the other side. However, sometimes you may want to make things asymmetrical to draw your eye to a particular spot.

      <strong>Slide 16:Symmetry</strong>
      This could refer to empty space surrounding the image to balance it out, or to cleverly insert graphic elements using negative space.

      <strong>Slide 26: Why is branding important?</strong>

      A strong brand connects with people. It helps them understand who you are, what you’re doing and why they should care. After looking at some of the brands on the previous slides, ask the learners to explain why they choose one brand over another? Think of your favourite cereal, or why you might choose Apple instead of Microsoft, or Google instead of Yahoo - or Oreos instead of No Name.

      <strong>Slide 27: Sketch your logo</strong>

      Make sure you have paper, pens or pencils for this exercise!

      <strong>Slide 37: Menu Options</strong>

      Close the Layers window, and show them how to re-open from the view menu.

      <strong>Slide 48: Menu Options</strong>

      Name the layer with Ryan's head! Naming layers is a good practice to keep things organized.

      <strong>Slide 51: SELECTIONS</strong>

      Take a moment to demonstrate how the lasso tool works. Most of the time, our subject is not on a solid contrasting colour background, so the magic wand tool will not always be the right tool for the job.

      <strong>Slide 52: FINAL TOUCHES</strong>

      You can use the marquee tool first to delete Ryan's shoulders, and then go in with the eraser to get closer to his beard.
      Erase too much of Ryan's chin, on purpose, to show how to use the history window or the ctrl + z to undo.
