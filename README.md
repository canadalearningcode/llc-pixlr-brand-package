This project uses editorconfig to maintain consistent coding style. Make sure your text editor has an editorconfig plugin installed.

Atom Users: The Whitespace plugin (which is installed by default) has Trim trailing whitespace option turned on by default. Turn this off in the Whitespace plugin settings, otherwise it overwrites the setting in .editorconfig. This is a known issue. This is only required for editing the slides. Workshop learners are not required to add this plugin.

Please refer to https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-slidedeck-template for instructions for customization of the slide deck and features.
